This is my first React project.

I live in Osaka, Japan and found that getting a driver's license here was pretty tough. I admit that my Japanese isn't quite good enough to take (and pass) the tests they give.

With that, I decided to make this web app that will be an online version of the tests they provide and try to capture the spirit of the tests.

I'm starting with the main 95 question test. I hope to add a time limit function and a variety of options to customize the test to help people learn.

I'm really so new to all of this, Github as well, so please feel free to reach out if you have any cool ideas you'd like to share. If you're in Osaka, give me a shout! Maybe we can meet up and talk code stuff.
